      <!-- Tips -->
      <div>
        <h2>Strategies and Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are unsure about a square, you can mark it with a question 
          mark (?). Later, you can either remove the
          markings or mark the square as a mine by right-clicking the square once
          or twice respectively.</li>
          <li>When you have flagged all the mines around a numbered square, you can
          uncover the rest of the squares around it by middle-clicking it or by 
          clicking it with the left and right buttons simultaneously. It will have
          no effect if too little or too many surrounding squares are flagged.</li>
          <li>Look for common patterns in numbers as they often indicate a corresponding
          pattern of mines. For example, the pattern 2-3-2 at the edge of a group
          of uncovered squares indicates a row of three mines next to the three
          numbers.</li>
