# "Losemine" (legacy version)
A [WinMine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Minesweeper) clone written in Java.

This was my submission for the final project for an introductory course in Java in 2012. Other than anonymizing the files, changing the package name, adding a Makefile and relicensing the project, the code is left as I submitted it.

## Building and running

To build the project, run

    make

To run the project, copy the generated `losemine-legacy.jar` file somewhere (it will create two files in that directory) and run it with

    cd path/to/losemine-legacy.jar
    java -jar losemine-legacy.jar
